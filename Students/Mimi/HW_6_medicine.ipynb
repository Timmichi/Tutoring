    "__Task:__ Eureka! Over the weekend you successfully identified the genomic sequence that causes the type of cancer your group is studying: GATTACAGGA. With the hope of someday engineering a cure, your immediate task is to identify which current drugs are best at eradicating the culprit sequence, so that your medical colleagues can use this information to design better and safer drugs going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you know:\n",
    "1. The patients whose files you analyzed last night have each undergone a course of treatment, where every sick patient was administered one of three drugs: Platinol, Carboplatin, or Taxotere, in doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg. Healthy patients did not receive any medication. After the completion of the treatment, all patients (sick and healthy) had their genome sequenced again. \n",
    "2. After dealing with their messy file formats over the weekend, you gave the hospital administrators a piece of your mind. Luckily, they listened! The files they have provided you with this time are much neater and more standardized. The first two lines of each file list the medication and the dosage, and the third line contains the patient's genome, e.g. a file's lines might read, in order: 'Platinol', '10mg', 'GATCA... etc.'. Phew! \n",
    "3. A patient is considered cured if the cancerous sequence GATTACAGGA is no longer present in their genome  printed in their medical file. \n",
    "4. You expect that at least one of the three drugs is effective at eliminating the GATTACAGGA sequence, but you don't know which one. Furthermore, you suspect that the dosage might impact the efficacy of the drug! \n",
    "\n",
    "__Your task is to analyze the patient medical files and deduce which drug(s) eradicated the GATTACAGGA sequence, and, if applicable, at which dosage(s) they are effective.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to use your code from last night's homework where helpful, but you will have to modify it in certain places. \n",
    "\n",
    "__For this assignment, please use Numpy arrays for all list creation and manipulation. Do not use Python lists.__ \n",
